# ML App to Build a Chatbot

This project aims to cover the process on how to build a chatbot. Generally, a chatbot can conduct a conversation or conversations through auditory or textual methods. These programmes are often designed to convincingly simulate or mimic a human conversational partner. Usually, they are far short of being able to pass the Turing test. Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes such as customer service or information acquisition. Some chatbots do utilise sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) systems, however there are many simpler ones scan for keywords within the input, then pull a reply accordingly with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a database.

## Breakdown for this Project:
- The Turing Test
- History of Chatbots
- Design of Chatbots
- Building a Chatbot
- LSTM model

## Dataset:

The dataset that will be used as the training data would be derived from real conversations with Cleverbot. The data from the main website cannot be found, but it can be found amongst other GitHub users such as these:
- https://github.com/neyerdav/chatbot
- https://github.com/GinGin3203/python_chatbot

## Required Libraries:

1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. OS
4. Re - regular expressions
5. IPyhon (Jupyter notebook image display)
6. Keras
7. PlaidML (for AMD GPU only)
8. Time
9. Tensorflow

## Summary:

I have learnt a lot from this chatbot building project. I was able to discover more from the history of chatbots ranging from ELIZA to MITSUKU and learnt how this landscape of chatbots have improved over time. I learnt new ways to treat and preprocess the text data such as limiting the number input text characters to speed up the training process,  creating stop tokens for the model, segmenting the text data into unique characters, or making sure that the input data dimensions are correct. More importantly, I was able to further develop my understanding of the LSTM model specifically the sequence-to-sequence model.
